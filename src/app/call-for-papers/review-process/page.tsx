                There is call for paper with firm deadline in terms of submission, acceptance, review of revised submission and camera-ready submission. The Editorial board has decided to implement desk review and rejection by the editorial board. On scrutinizing the papers by the editorial board if the papers rejected in the process of desk review that will not assign any review further. All submissions will be screened for plagiarism by iThenticateÂ®, and when identified, the submissions by the same author will be rejected at any stage of the conference even after the conference and after the publication of the proceedings online from the springer. The question of reimbursement of registration fees will not be applicable here.
